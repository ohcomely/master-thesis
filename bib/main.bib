Our results additionally indicate that the performance of the minimal degree algorithm can be significantly influenced by the way in which ties are broken. We also discuss the dissection of irregularly shaped regions and the extension of George’s ordering to three-dimensional regions.},

  abstract = {J. A. George has discovered a method, called nested dissection, for solving a system of linear equations defined on an \$n = k {\textbackslash}times k\$ square grid in \$O(n{\textbackslash}log n)\$ and space \$O(n{\textasciicircum}\{\{3 /2\}\} )\$ time. We generalize this method without degrading the time and space bounds so that it applies to any system of equations defined on a planar or almost-planar graph. Such systems arise in the solution of two-dimensional finite element problems. Our method uses the fact that planar graphs have good separators.More generally, we show that sparse Gaussian elimination is efficient for any class of graphs which have good separators, and conversely that graphs without good separators (including “almost all” sparse graphs) are not amenable to sparse Gaussian elimination.},

We show that if these objects can be listed in polynomial time for a class of graphs, the treewidth and the minimum fill-in are polynomially tractable for these graphs. We prove that for all classes of graphs for which polynomial algorithms computing the treewidth and the minimum fill-in exist, we can list their potential maximal cliques in polynomial time. Our approach unifies these algorithms. Finally we show how to compute in polynomial time the potential maximal cliques of weakly triangulated graphs for which the treewidth and the minimum fill-in problems were open.},
