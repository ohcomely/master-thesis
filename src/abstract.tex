\chapter*{Abstract}

Sparse symmetric linear systems arise across computational science and engineering. Solving these systems efficiently via direct methods depends critically on matrix reordering to minimize fill-in during factorization. Finding optimal reorderings is NP-complete, necessitating good heuristic approaches. This thesis presents a comprehensive evaluation of sparse matrix reordering algorithms, comparing classical methods, graph partitioning approaches, and hypergraph-based techniques across diverse matrix structures. We assess multiple performance metrics including fill-in reduction, execution time, memory usage, and parallelization potential. Our benchmarking reveals that advanced methods achieve better fill-in reduction compared to classical algorithms, though at higher computational cost. We implemented several enhancements, including a Nested Dissection variant with improved coarsening and a GPU-accelerated RCM implementation, demonstrating significant performance improvements. The results establish some trade-offs between ordering quality and computational overhead, providing guidance for algorithm selection and future research directions in sparse matrix reordering.
